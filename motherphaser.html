			The motherphaser was built few years ago. Build around 3 LM13700 OTAs.</br><br> The phase circuit has
			6 variable all pass filter and 2 fixed all pass filter. This gives a richer sound than the traditional 4 stages
			phaser. </br></br>
			
			Some rarely seen features are present. A "volume" control to let the output signal be a bit more hot (it avoids having
			the know volume drop thing), a "sweep" that shift the LFO signal up or down the voltage range. There's also a "leslie cabinet"
			switching type of thing, that allow the change of two LFO speed, controlled by a "lag" circuit. The new speed takes a certain
			amount of time before reaching the target speed. </br></br>
			
			To add even more crazyness, a momentary footswitch is here to put the lfo at max and let speed decrease according to the 
			the lag control. </br></br>
			
			The resonnance control may lead to unpleasant oscillaton, if the input signal is too strong distortion may apper as well (OTAs). 
			</br></br>
			
			An ever cool version could be made with the LFO circuitry changed for microcontroller that could give more things to play with. </br></br>
