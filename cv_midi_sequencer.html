	<h1 class="line_text"> CV MIDI SEQUENCER</h1>
		<p>		
				a midi sequencer that converts midi note to CV, ideally thought to be used with 1v/oct eurorack VCOs.</br></br> 
				
				It was firstly designed to be an eurorack module (with the small vintage nokia graphic display) but the futur largeness of it turned it into 
				a stand-alone device. Nonetheless the lack of direct control and the deep menu browsering made the project 
				not very intuitive, unless it was linked to a midi controller with knobs and switches. However, in this case the all purpose of a small 
				device was totally lost. I re-work the project and the code several times to land on this inevitable : we need things to turn and 
				push to have a enjoyable experience. </br></br>		
				
				Also considering the recent explosion of small general purpose devices (Ipad, smartphone, tablette and surfaces) do we still need 
				a pure dedicated interface for something as trivial as this ? whereas a software program and a small module to convert datas
				into the analog world would suffice ? </br></br>
