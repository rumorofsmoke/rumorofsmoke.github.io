		<p>		
			
			buying old so-called "remanufactured" fuel injectors isn't the safest thing to do. I bought some from ebay and I got very 
			bad results. </br> </br>
			
			My car doesn't have all the bells and whistles that modern rolling shitty car have today (which is a good thing) The diagnostic aid doesn't have 
			acess to the injectors rails. </br></br>
		
			There's a cheap chinese product to do the same job, but I wanted to build something more robust and reliable.</br></br>
			this project will be housed in a aluminium box when I'll manage to find courage to drill it (hate that)  </br></br>

			nothing very brilliant here, I'm using a STM30F0 to product repeated pulses using the PWM module of the chip. This simulates the ON/OFF period
			for the coil to be energised and open the channel for the fuel to pass through. </br></br>

			The test consists of measuring the loss of pressure for each injectors which should match with -/+ 10% of the reference value </br></br>
